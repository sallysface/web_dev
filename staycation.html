        <hr>
        <p> Salt lake is a very pretty and is named after a very salty lake. The salty lake is called the great salt lake and is so salty you can float on it.

        <h2> Why I Love the Movie!</h2>
        <p> I love the movie because I use to be a dancer and the dancing is very good! It really connects to me and I am also in love with Patrick Swayze. In the movie he dances with the protagonist and falls in love with her. I wish I was the protagonist in the story so I could dance with him and we could get married. I do think I would be a better partner for him then her but the overall story is really good and really connects to me and the music is really good. </p>

      <p> Diry dancing is a old movie made in the 80s. It was a very popular movie because of the storyline and the cast. Personally I like both a lot. The story is almost like footlose with the whole "no ddancing law." It is my favorit movie in the whole world and I like it very very much! My favorit part is when patrick swayzy says " no one puts baby in a corrner. The movie had me interested the whole time. I could watch it on repeate and never get board. I love this movie so much!</p>
