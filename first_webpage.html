        <h2>⋆｡°✩Episode 1 Plot⋆｡°✩</h2> <hr>
        <p>A young Sal Fisher wakes up in a sterile hospital room, his face wrapped in bandages. As he gets up to explore, the atmosphere quickly turns eerie. The room appears normal at first, but Sal moves through the hospital corridors, things began to change, blood splatters the walls, the light flicker, and strange whispers echo around him. As he navigates this dreamlike sequence, he encounters a dog, who cryptically tells him that he is not alone. The surreal and unsettling nature of this introduction hints at the psychological horror elements that will define the game. After this eerie dream sequence, a now 15-year-old Sal with a prosthetic face wakes up in reality, revealing that he and his father had moved from New Jersey to the Addison Apartments building in the town of Nockfell. The day before their arrival, one of the other residents, Mrs. Sanderson, is murdered. Sal explores and meets the other tenants, including Larry Johnson, who reveals he witnessed the murder. Sal helps Larry find evidence that the murderer was Charley Mansfield, one of the other tenants. They present the evidence to the police, and he is arrested. In the present, Sal recounts the story to his therapist, Dr. Enon, as he is on death row for mass murder.</p>
