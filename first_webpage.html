        <h2>⋆｡°✩Episode 1 Plot⋆｡°✩</h2> <hr>
        <p>A young Sal Fisher wakes up in a sterile hospital room, his face wrapped in bandages. As he gets up to explore, the atmosphere quickly turns eerie. The room appears normal at first, but Sal moves through the hospital corridors, things began to change, blood splatters the walls, the light flicker, and strange whispers echo around him. As he navigates this dreamlike sequence, he encounters a dog, who cryptically tells him that he is not alone. The surreal and unsettling nature of this introduction hints at the psychological horror elements that will define the game. After this eerie dream sequence, a now 15-year-old Sal with a prosthetic face wakes up in reality, revealing that he and his father had moved from New Jersey to the Addison Apartments building in the town of Nockfell. The day before their arrival, one of the other residents, Mrs. Sanderson, is murdered. Sal explores and meets the other tenants, including Larry Johnson, who reveals he witnessed the murder. Sal helps Larry find evidence that the murderer was Charley Mansfield, one of the other tenants. They present the evidence to the police, and he is arrested. In the present, Sal recounts the story to his therapist, Dr. Enon, as he is on death row for mass murder.</p>

    <h2>⋆｡°✩Episode 2 Plot⋆｡°✩</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The episode begins with Sal experiencing another disturbing dream, hinting at his traumatic past and a growing supernatural presence around him. When he wakes up, Larry tells him that he has been hearing strange noises in the basement of the apartment complex. Believing it could be linked to the murder from the previous episode, the two decide to investigate further. Larry tells Sal that he feels a demon has cursed him in the building. They both uncover hidden areas within the basement, including a room filled with strange symbols, dark rituals, and an ominous presence that suggests the building is haunted by something much worse than just ghosts. As they dig deeper, Sal experiences terrifying visions of a demonic figure, hinting at a greater evil tied to the apartments. Sal promises to help him and goes to Todd Morrison, a tenant their age who creates gadgets. Todd modifies Sal's "Gear Boy" into the “Super Gear Boy” to be able to detect supernatural spots. Together, the three of them explore the building. On the top floor, which is under renovation, Sal enters a secret room, where he encounters the demon. Larry steps in to save Sal and eliminates the demon with a gadget made by Todd. In the present, Sal is taken away while Enon visits the treehouse, where he is scared by the ghost of Larry and is killed after he falls from the tree, breaking his neck.</p>
